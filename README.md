#  Tic-Tac-Toe
C Programming Project
 * Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. It is usually played on paper but as the technology evolved, here is a digital version of it.
 * This topic was chosen because it gives me an opportunity to implement and understand multiple C programming concepts.
